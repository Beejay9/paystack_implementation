# resume-app
The app is a basic resume app that shows my image, social media details and my skills and experience.
The code base is relatively simple. It is written with dart and flutter. When the app launches, you're taken to a screen with my image, name, and what I do. There are two buttons; the first is to show my social media links, and the second page will take you to a new page with my resume.
I came up with the inspiration for the design myself.
I basically used only the flutter library.
Features I'd like to include are, links that will actually take users to my social media platforms, rather than just displaying names.

The challenge I faced was uploading the app on appetize.io. I was able to solve this by following steps laid out by the mentors and other interns.
